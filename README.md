# Project Auth API

This is my first authentification form project at Technigo ( week 16 )

## The problem

It was very challenging to work with authentification, but I learned a lot. (How the front and backend are connected and what needs to be taken care of...)
I also tried to work with TS with both front and back, so that was also a challenge for me. I even implemented to validation of a form of data in the frontend to make sure the data is secure and correct. I implemented a simple validation for the backend, which should be improved.
Though learning authentification, I found it very important to take care of Web security well, so I would like to work on my security of API and application in a better way.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
