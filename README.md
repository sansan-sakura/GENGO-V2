This is the V2 of GENGO, a full-stack flashcard application I made for the final project at coding boot camp, Technigo. <a href="https://github.com/sansan-sakura/GENGO">GENGO-V1</a><br/>

## Used Tech

- Shadcn UI
- React/Vite
- TypeScript
- Node.js/Express
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Clerk/Webhook


## The problem

I had a huge problem with the clerk connecting to the frontend and backend and synchronizing with the database. I had never used Webhook and had no idea how to work with it, nor was there much information on how to connect Clerk to MongoDB. 
So I did a lot of research and asked my former boot camp teacher for advice. It was a long process to get the database and clerk to work together, but it worked in the end. I also struggled with using middleware to check if a user is authenticated. 
It was an absolutely good exercise in terms of authentication and understanding the back end. So I'm really happy that I didn't give up and that it finally worked. 
The biggest strategy for this project was to take a break and do something else to learn more about programming. It helped me immensely in saving time. 

This is a v2 of GENGO, built with similar stacks but without clerk, shaddon and backend without TS. Even it was similar and I could copy and paste a lot of code, making refactoring along the way and implementing another tech more difficult than I expected. 

Finally, I am working on V3, built with NEXT.js 14 and focused on Swedish. I am thinking of implementing more features like a calendar that is synchronized with the database, chat, and more.
